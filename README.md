# polygontransform
Polygon transform Challenge: Write a library of static methods that performs various geometric transforms on polygons. Mathematically, a polygon is defined by its sequence of vertices (x0, y 0), (x 1, y 1), (x 2, y 2), …. In Java, we will represent a polygon by storing the x– and y-coordinates of the vertices in two parallel arrays x[] and y[].
